# Gleam Reference

> [!WARNING]  
> This is still, very, *very*, WIP. Some information is probably incorrect and there are many places that could use better wording.


<!-- TODO: Dynamic table of contents here -->
<!-- TODO: Use the following quote from Lewis somewhere "As our hero lambdaman says: object oriented programming is well named because if someone says you should use it then you should object" -->


## When should I use Gleam?
Whenever or wherever you'd use BEAM or Javascript.


## Is Gleam Imperitive?
Gleam is a functional programing language.



## Targets
Refrence: [#109](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/issues/109)

### Builtin
 - Erlang (BEAM)
 - Javascript (NodeJS/Bowser/Anywhere else JS runs)

### Other
#### Wasm
 - `Gleam->Erlang->Wasm`
    - [Firefly](https://github.com/GetFirefly/firefly)
    - [AtomVM](https://www.atomvm.net/)
 - `Gleam->Javascript->Wasm`
   - [Javy](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy)
   - [JCO](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco) ([ComponentizeJS](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS))
 - `Gleam->Wasm`
   - WIP - Creator's doing it as part of a school project so not public at the moment.

<!-- TODO: Do some more research into the targets below -->
#### IoT / Microcontrollers / Embeded Devices
 - [AtomVM](https://www.atomvm.net/)

#### Desktop
 - [AtomVM](https://www.atomvm.net/)
 - [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) ([blog post](https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2024/gleam-tauri/))

#### Andriod
 - JS in WebView (e.g. [Tauri](https://tauri.app/))


## Does Gleam Have A Garbage Collector?
Gleam itself does not have a garbage collector as it source-to-source compiles from Gleam to Javascript and Erlang. However, Erlang and Javascript do have a garbage collector. Don't let having a garbage collector fool you into thinking it's slow, Erlang (BEAM) powers giants like Discord and WhatsApp easily.



## Division By Zero 
Gleam doesn't throw errors unless explicitly told to do so. So it just doesn't throw an error. There is also [this](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/divide-by-zero/) article that goes into more details. Also see the [Int](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/int.html) and [float](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/float.html) docs.



## Views On Crashing / Throwing Errors
See the `Division By Zero` section.



## Gleam Written In Gleam (Bootstraping The Gleam Compiler)
No, this is probably never gonning happen. It's easier to bootstrap a language when it's still young and small, not when it hits `1.0`. As Louis said,  ... <!-- TODO: Add a quote from Discord explaining talking about this -->



## Name For People Who Use Gleam
`Gleamlins`. There's also Glemlins, Gleamers, and a few other ones, but we prefer Gleamlins.



## Can Gleam Interop With...? (FFI)
Gleam has builtin FFI support for Javascript and Erlang. Any other languages have to be done through Javascript's or Erlang's FFI for your language. For example WASM for JS and NIFs for Erlang. There's also this [blog post](https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/01/11/exploring_the_gleam_ffi/) about Gleam's FFI.



## Operator Overloading/Defining New Operators
No. Gleam is designed to be simple and this would defeat that. If you realy want this than look into some sort of templating.
<!-- TODO: Make a library for this. Use cases: JSX, operator overloading, math libraries, etc. I want to make this but idk how soon I'll get around to it. -->



## Constants Aren't Immutable?
They actually are, you're probably seeing shadowing in effect. Shadowing only affects local scope and doesn't mutate the orignal value. However, if it somehow turns out not to be shadowing, then please submit a bug report! ü•∫üôè



## Does Gleam Have `X` Datastructure?
This [blog post](https://mckayla.blog/posts/all-you-need-is-data-and-functions.html) that discuss this in a nice, clear, and concise way.



## InteliJ Support
Unfortunately InteliJ doesn't support LSP<sup>`¬ß`</sup>, the standard protocol for IDE tooling. Due to their unwillingness to implement the LSP protocol, IDE tooling maintainers either need a complex LSP to InteliJ translation layer or rewrite all their tooling for one single editor. Both options are terrible, so it's unlikely that Gleam will have offical support for InteliJ. There are however a few (old) community projects for InteliJ support.

`¬ß` - Basic support is in paid version but very basic and not in free version



## No Loops?
Gleam is a functional programing language which don't have loops. In functional languages you just use recurrsion. Infinite recursion is also very efficent in functional languages. Details as to why can be found [here](https://beautifulracket.com/explainer/recursion.html).
