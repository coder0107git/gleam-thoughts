# Gleam Stuff

## TO-DOs
- Improve (add) package index fuzzy searching
- Make a templating lib (similar to `bbmustache` and JS tagged template literals)


## Ideas
- Make error code messages that reference docs pages be short links so it's harder for links to become stale and break.
- Discord Welcome Channel to make handling the volume of people joining more manageable.
- ~~Discord channel for functional programing newbs~~ NVM, questions channel
